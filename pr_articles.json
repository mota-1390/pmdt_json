In partnership with <a href=\"https://www.recora.com/\">Recora</a>, ProMedica now enables patients to leverage virtual tools to access on-demand cardiac recovery care teams and other resources.</p>\n<p>The program empowers patients to manage their heart health from home while enabling providers to deliver comprehensive cardiac care and strengthen patient relationships. Recora's Cardiac Recovery Program moves beyond 12 weeks of rehabilitation to deliver comprehensive care management that focuses on a patient's overall health and wellness.</p>\n<p>\"The future of cardiac rehabilitation is moving to a virtual environment, and we know it is imperative we are prepared to deliver this service to our patients,\u201d said Linda Chambers, associate vice president of rehabilitation services at ProMedica. \"By adding a virtual program, we expect to see our patients increase activity in cardiac rehab from the traditional model, which would likely provide tremendous improvements in patient outcomes and increase expected years of living. With the program\u2019s ease-of-use and ability to eliminate barriers to attending sessions, we are excited to see the impact this will make on our community.\"</p>\n<p>Recora currently serves cardiac patients in the U.S. across health systems, health plans and medical groups in urban, suburban and rural communities.</p>\n<p>\"It is a thrill to partner with ProMedica on their journey towards providing virtual cardiac rehab to the people of Ohio and Michigan,\" said Recora CEO Abhishek Chandra. \u201cThe need for cardiac rehab patients to increase engagement in recovery programs has never been greater. With only 1 in 4 eligible patients starting cardiac rehab, adding a virtual option has been shown to engage more patients overall, greatly reduce hospital readmissions, and significantly increase the number of patients who complete their cardiac recovery program.\u201d</p>\n<p>Recora's Cardiac Recovery Program has garnered industry-leading results that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15% hospital readmission rate for Recora patients, versus the national average of 43% across Medicare patients with heart failure at six months.</li>\n<li>87% Recora cardiac recovery program completion rate, versus the national average of 26%.</li>\n<li>80% of patients with hypertension markedly improved their blood pressure due to diet and exercise</li>\n<li>94% of Recora patients adhere to their cardiac medication.</li>\n<li>80% improvement of distance and strength gains among Recora patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patients interested in exploring the option of virtual cardiac rehabilitation should contact their ProMedica physician or sign up to determine eligibility through <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><a href=\"https://app.recora.com/patients/signup/promedica\" style=\"color: #008000;\">https://app.recora.com/patients/signup/promedica</a></span>.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,271571\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Randy Oostra made the decision to retire after 25 years with the organization. Over the past six months, Mr. Oostra has worked closely with Mr. Polizzi to prepare him for the chief executive officer role and help ensure a smooth transition in leadership.</p>\n<p>While Mr. Oostra had discussions about retirement and succession planning with the board prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, he chose to hold off when the unprecedented public health issue arose. Leading the organization through the uncertainty and challenges of the pandemic became his top priority.</p>\n<p>With the pandemic more under control now, he is moving forward with his retirement plan. His last day at ProMedica will be October 31, 2022.</p>\n<p>Mr. Oostra began his tenure at ProMedica as vice president at ProMedica Toledo Hospital in 1997. Then, he served as the president of multiple ProMedica hospitals before being promoted to chief operating officer and president of the health system in 2006. He has served as president and chief executive officer since 2009.</p>\n<p>\u201cServing ProMedica for the last 25 years has been the highlight of my career,\u201d said ProMedica CEO Randy Oostra. \u201cOver the years, we have had the pleasure of working with so many dedicated caregivers, board members, and community leaders who have inspired our work daily. As part of ProMedica, I\u2019ve also been grateful for the opportunity to connect with many incredible individuals as we have worked to address the social factors that significantly impact health outcomes. Together, we have made meaningful progress in the way health care is delivered. It has been a true honor and privilege to lead ProMedica and serve our communities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arturo Polizzi is an experienced executive with a demonstrated history of working in the hospital and health care industry. He is highly skilled in nonprofit organizations, strategy, operations, team building and business development. He started his career in 1998 at ProMedica as an in-house attorney. Over the past 20 years, he has served in various strategic and operational roles at the organization, including associate general counsel, chief human resources officer and president of the metro Toledo ProMedica hospitals. Prior to returning to ProMedica as the chief operating officer in 2020, Mr. Polizzi served as the president and CEO at Christ Hospital Health Network in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked closely with Arturo for many years, and I\u2019m confident he will be an exceptional CEO for ProMedica,\u201d said Oostra. \u201cWe have been working on a transition plan for some time, and despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, he is well prepared to continue moving the organization toward long-term financial stability and success.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn behalf of ProMedica\u2019s board of directors, I want to thank Randy Oostra for his 25 years of commitment to the organization and the remarkable impact he has had on our communities,\u201d said ProMedica Board Chairman Bob LaClair. \u201cRandy has played a pivotal role in helping to transform health care, establishing ProMedica as a leader in addressing the social determinants of health starting more than a decade ago. He has also embraced the anchor Institution philosophy in a way that few other leaders have, resulting in wide-reaching community support that has been a catalyst for many positive changes. We have been inspired by his leadership and commitment to health care and the community, and we wish him all the best in his next chapter.</p>\n<p>Mr. LaClair continued, \u201cWe are pleased to confirm Arturo Polizzi as ProMedica\u2019s next CEO. His extensive, proven leadership at ProMedica and previous health network CEO experience make him a strong asset, and we are confident that Arturo is the ideal choice to further ProMedica\u2019s mission and lead the organization into the future.\u201d</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,271470\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The investment from the Adrian Dominican Sisters aims to connect participating youth and their families with available community resources, expanding literacy and family education programs. ProMedica will serve as the fiscal manager of the new investment, building upon the pre-existing ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe made this investment as part of a congregational commitment to help build resilient communities with local partners that have the capacity to maximize impact in places where our Sisters have had a long-term engagement,\u201d said Patricia Siemen, OP, Prioress of the congregation. \u201cOur Sisters have ministered in the Adrian community since 1879 and it is our hope that this investment, managed by ProMedica and made in collaboration with our other community partners \u2013 Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee and All About Adrian Resident Coalition \u2013 will enrich the lives of our neighbors on the east side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Announced earlier this year, the ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise is a community-driven initiative for rural investment and community development. Focusing on a core neighborhood with a total population of nearly 11,000 residents, it involves working with residents and stakeholders to close existing gaps in resource availability, accessibility, and attainability and eliminate disparities by investing in new and proven strategies. The initiative intends to help improve the conditions in which residents live, work and play so they are empowered to achieve their highest health potential.</p>\n<p>Through extensive interviews with community members and demographic research, the Adrian Dominican Sisters\u2019 Adrian Resilient Communities Committee worked with local organizations and neighborhood leaders to develop a comprehensive plan to address specific inequities faced by east Adrian youth and their families. Efforts that will be supported by the Adrian Dominican Sisters\u2019 new investment include:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Developing life skills for youth through the social and emotional learning programs housed at the <span style=\"color: #339966;\"><a href=\"https://www.bgclenawee.org/\" style=\"color: #339966;\">Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee</a></span>.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Connecting youth and their families with community services through a part-time community and family liaison who will work with local mentors to identify additional services needed.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Expanding literacy and family education programs in east Adrian. The All About Adrian Resident Coalition, local public schools, and other organizations will collaborate on the development of programs aimed at continuing and expanding literacy activities.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Creating an Adrian Ebeid Technology Center in east Adrian that will house the Adrian Dominican Sisters Youth Learning Center and computer lab. The center will provide learning opportunities for youth in English language skills, GED preparation and computer skills.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Hunter, executive director of campus services at the Adrian Dominican Motherhouse and co-chair of the Adrian Resilient Communities Committee, said, \u201cI have no doubt that the Adrian Dominican Sisters\u2019 partnerships and commitment to building resilient communities will enhance the lives of our youth, their families, and our Adrian community, both today and well into the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis investment is an excellent example of anchor institutions aligning their missions to address health disparities and inequities within the community,\u201d said Frank Nagle, director of community impact in Michigan for ProMedica. \u201cWe greatly appreciate the Adrian Dominican Sisters Resilient Community Investment to the ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise. This catalyzes a partnership and expands upon a program that addresses the social determinants of health to improve the health and well-being of the community.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cody Waters, chief executive officer of Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee said, \u201cThis generous investment allows the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Lenawee the ability to focus our efforts on providing young people with the support necessary to become productive, caring and responsible citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCreating a better quality of life for a community only happens when everyone is welcomed to the table. When we all are heard and everyone's hands are to the plow does collective effort create a resilient impact,\u201d said DeAngelo Boone, founder of The All About Adrian Resident Coalition.</p>\n<p>ProMedica\u2019s investment in rural placemaking is based on the success of the ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise in Toledo, Ohio, in 2016. ProMedica established the initiative to catalyze innovations that help to improve community health and well-being with a focus on social determinants of health. ProMedica will oversee and support the outlined efforts, complementing the existing place-based investment.</p>\n<p><em><strong></strong></em></p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,270612\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Award\">\n<p><strong>MONROE, Michigan, June 9, 2022</strong> - The Michigan Health and Hospital Association (MHA) Keystone Center honored Beth Bedra, patient safety officer at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital, June 9 with the quarterly MHA Keystone Center Speak-up! Award.</p>\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, changes were made to the main entrance at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital to accommodate infection control requirements for patient visitors. However, the revised entrance utilized a revolving door that was not suitable for all visitors and posed a safety risk. Beth personally examined the door, reviewed video footage of how patients and their care partners enter and exit the facility and engaged other staff in identifying solutions. As a result, she led efforts to revise the entrance that accommodates the needs of all visitors at the hospital and ensures the safest walkway possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m honored to be a recipient of this award and to know that as a team, we\u2019ve been able to improve the patient and visitor experience at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital,\u201d said Bedra. \u201cI\u2019m thankful we have a culture where I could speak up and suggest a change that is in the best interest of safety at the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p>Launched in March 2016, the MHA Keystone Center Speak-up! Award acknowledges individuals or teams within MHA Keystone Center Patient Safety Organization hospitals who speak up to prevent potential harm to patients or other staff members. The award fosters a culture within healthcare organizations that empowers staff to speak up about the quality or safety of patient care.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are incredibly grateful to have Beth as part of our team,\u201d said Darrin Arquette, president, ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital. \u201cHer years of safety experience, in addition to her perceptive observation skills and attention to detail help improve the safety and quality of care for our staff, patients and their care partners on a daily basis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Additional award finalists for the first quarter of 2022 include:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Jennifer Helman, NP, C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital \u2022 Erin Munsel, PharmD, BCCPS, C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital</p>\n<p>\u2022 Jenny Burton, Helen Newberry Joy Hospital</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pandemic has created incredible challenges for hospitals and in many instances, drastically changed the visitor experience,\u201d said MHA CEO Brian Peters. \u201cBeth is a great example that despite the increased stress on healthcare workers, they still display an unwavering commitment to improving safety for all who enter their facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Specifics on the MHA Keystone Center Speak-up!

This represents one of the nation\u2019s largest place-based investments made in a rural community.</p>\n<p>ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise is a community driven initiative for rural investment and community development. It will involve working with residents and stakeholders to close existing gaps in resource availability, accessibility, and attainability and eliminate disparities by investing in new and proven strategies. The initiative is intended to help improve the conditions in which residents live, work, and play to empower them to achieve their highest health potential.</p>\n<p>ProMedica and the Lenawee Community Foundation recognize that sustainable community change requires long-term engagement, trust building and investment with and by the community. ProMedica Adrian Ebeid Neighborhood Promise will leverage the expertise of residents, businesses, and stakeholders, the unique assets of Lenawee County, and best practices for rural community development from other parts of the country to accelerate health and economic stability for thousands of individuals. Services and programs will be paired with economic learning and research to help ensure solutions will have a positive impact for generations to come.</p>\n<p>As part of the initiative, the community will address and reduce barriers to health and economic vitality through policy, education, targeted social services programs, and evidence-based solutions while embracing the culture, diversity, arts, community and history of the region. The vision and voice of the community will guide partnerships and investments focused on building and expanding the capacities of neighborhood infrastructure. Partners will co-design a physical space within the neighborhood to be operated by a diverse workforce, which will serve as a gathering place and facilitate job training, financial coaching, and other community services and resources.</p>\n<p>Through data analysis and extensive conversations with neighborhood leaders and stakeholders, ProMedica and its partners have developed a deeper understanding of the lack of funding, infrastructure, and services in east Adrian. With significant long-term and intentional investment through this initiative, the community will be positioned to build upon the great work started by the All About Adrian Resident Coalition, City of Refuge Ministries International, Habitat for Humanity and several other organizations. The ProMedica Foundation will continue to support the effort through fundraising at the local and national levels to secure resources for the initiative. These generous philanthropic contributions raised from donors and partners will unite the community and make a lasting impact.</p>\n<p>The initiative will focus on a core neighborhood that has a total population of nearly 11,000 residents. Of the 7,807 households within the core market, nearly half are rental properties and 17% are severely cost-burdened. An average of 28.1% of individuals residing in the core market are living at or below the federal poverty threshold and experience the following conditions:</p>\n<p>\u2022 18% of adults do not have health insurance; The rate increases to 38% when income is less than $25,000.</p>\n<p>\u2022 10/100 Housing Stability Index</p>\n<p>\u2022 17/100 Education Index \u2022 19/100 Health &amp; Well-Being Index</p>\n<p>\u2022 15/100 Economic Stability Index</p>\n<p>Data Sources: 2020 Lenawee Community Health Assessment U.S. Census ACS 2015-2019 Enterprise Community Partners 2020</p>\n<p>ProMedica\u2019s investment in rural placemaking is based on the success of the ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise in Toledo, Ohio, in 2016. ProMedica established the initiative to catalyze innovations that help to improve community health and well-being with a focus on social determinants of health. These efforts are centered around community voice, data-based decision making, and a focus on whole person health.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,266893\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The campaign, appropriately titled \u2018Share the Love\u2019, will run from Valentine\u2019s Day through the end of February.</p>\n<p>Early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an outpouring of public support for health care workers that included gestures like meal donations, sign displays and sidewalk chalk messages. Those gestures were greatly appreciated, especially as caregivers dealt with much uncertainty about the new disease. But as the pandemic has lingered, those gestures waned. Yet, with repeated surges, health care workers across the industry have continued to face some of the greatest challenges in their careers.</p>\n<p>Occupational strain and mental stress are a reality of an extended pandemic. But, now that we are on the downside of the largest surge to date, ProMedica Foundation sees an opportunity for the community to help uplift weary health care workers.</p>\n<p>The \u2018Share the Love\u2019 fundraising campaign enables community members to donate any amount and no amount is too small. The campaign also offers community members the opportunity to provide a special message of encouragement to health care workers. The messages will be printed on green paper hearts and displayed in employee areas at ProMedica health care facilities across northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.</p>\n<p>The campaign will also include Match Mondays. That means ProMedica Foundation will match every donation that comes in on the Mondays throughout the campaign up to $5000.00. Those dates include February 14, 21 and 28.</p>\n<p>All funds raised through the campaign will go directly toward providing uplifting experiences for ProMedica caregivers at work. The experiences will be at the discretion of team leaders to help ensure they are tailored to individual teams and environments. Experiences could include things like special catered meals, chair massage sessions, aromatherapy, fun team-building activities and more.</p>\n<p>To donate to the \u2018Share the Love\u2019 fundraising campaign and offer a message of encouragement for ProMedica caregivers, text \u201cLove\u201d to 36413.&nbsp;</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,266890\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

In addition to the U.S. Women\u2019s Open presenting sponsorship, as part of the long-term relationship, ProMedica becomes the official health and well-being partner of the USGA.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Women\u2019s Open has led the way for more than 75 years and is already considered the world\u2019s premier women\u2019s golf championship. To retain and enhance its standing, most immediately and beginning with the 2022 championship that will be conducted June 2-5 at Pine Needles Lodge &amp; Golf Club in Southern Pines, N.C., the purse will nearly double, increasing from $5.5 million to $10 million, the highest in women\u2019s golf and among the leaders in all of women\u2019s sports. The USGA also announced a commitment to raise the Women\u2019s Open purse to $11 million and then $12 million over the next five years.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe USGA prides itself on conducting championships that not only provide an incredible stage for the athletes, but also give younger players something to dream about,\u201d said Mike Whan, CEO of the USGA. \u201cFor more than 75 years, the U.S. Women\u2019s Open has been the one that every little girl, in every country around the world, has dreamed of winning. This partnership with ProMedica allows us to substantially grow the championship in every way, from its purpose, to its purse, to the places that host the event. While I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we are announcing today, I know this is just the beginning, as together with ProMedica, we\u2019ll push to change the game and what it means to young women worldwide in order to reach new heights every year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Key to the partnership is a joint commitment by the organizations to highlight the importance of addressing health inequities across the United States, which will include sharing the personal stories of golfers and USGA competitors nationwide who have used golf as a means to a healthier lifestyle.</p>\n<p>ProMedica will also utilize the global stage the U.S. Women\u2019s Open provides to generate charitable dollars for its <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/impact-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">ProMedica Impact Fund</a>, which will become the official charity of the U.S. Women\u2019s Open. The ProMedica Impact Fund is committed to raising more than $1 billion over eight years to strategically invest in grants, impact investments, and research and learning activities, all designed to improve individual and community health. The partners will conduct fundraising to support social determinants of health (SDOH) initiatives and other programs in championship communities.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith this unprecedented partnership, both organizations are breaking new ground,\u201d said Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO. \u201cProMedica will benefit from taking its work in social determinants of health onto a national stage, while the USGA will benefit from the opportunity to embrace a not-for-profit organization whose mission and support will elevate its signature women\u2019s event.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou simply cannot talk about improving the health and well-being of all individuals without talking about the disproportionate impact of social determinants of health on women. The U.S. Women\u2019s Open is a perfect platform for bringing this message to a much broader audience,\u201d said Oostra.</p>\n<p>As a piece of the partnership, ProMedica will provide on-site medical services at several USGA championships, as well as deliver health and well-being experiences for fans on-site and throughout host communities.</p>\n<p>The USGA today also named five additional U.S. Women\u2019s Open host sites: The Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. (2026); Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio (2027); Pinehurst Resort &amp; Country Club in Village of Pinehurst, N.C. (2029); Interlachen Country Club in Edina, Minn.

This is the fifth consecutive year Mr. Oostra has received national recognition from <i>Modern Healthcare</i>.</p>\n<p>This prestigious recognition program acknowledges and honors individuals deemed by their peers and the senior editors of Modern Healthcare to be the most influential in the industry in terms of leadership and impact. Entries for the recognition are accepted from all sectors of the health care industry for senior-level executives, high-level government administrators and executives, elected officials, academics and thought leaders.</p>\n<p>According to Modern Healthcare, \"Last year's complexity is reflected in our 2021 Most Influential People in Healthcare honorees. The year was dominated with vaccines that promised a return to normal. But that treatment faced ire and rejection from some, creating divisions in communities and even the health care workforce,\u201d said Modern Healthcare Editor Aurora Aguilar. \u201cMeanwhile, the financial sector threw around its weight in health care, causing some pushback from the industry and regulators who say private equity and venture capital's goals conflict with health care's mission. Still, there's no denying that new players affected the business of health care in 2021.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cWith all of the extraordinary and sustained demands we have experienced during the ongoing pandemic, it is an incredible honor for ProMedica to be recognized by Modern Healthcare once again,\u201d said Randy Oostra, president and CEO, ProMedica. \u201cThroughout 2021, ProMedica team members have continued to overcome challenges and put the needs of others before their own, working tirelessly to care for and support our patients, residents, members and their families.

The agreement will also transfer the management of operations of Emory\u2019s skilled nursing facility, Budd Terrace at Wesley Woods, to ProMedica. The management agreement will become effective Sept. 1, 2021.</p>\n<p>The joint venture demonstrates how health systems and post-hospital and rehabilitative care experts with advanced knowledge of the health care continuum can collaborate to develop innovative care solutions. By leveraging their respective skills and expertise, ProMedica, the nation\u2019s largest not-for-profit post-hospital care provider, and Emory Healthcare, a renowned health care and academic institution, are uniquely positioned to improve health care connectivity and access to resources that help patients transition between hospital and home in the Atlanta area. Beginning Sept. 1, ProMedica will manage the day-to-day operations at Budd Terrace, while Emory will be involved with quality performance and strategic planning initiatives.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are pleased to collaborate with ProMedica as we enhance and expand skilled nursing and rehabilitative services for those who need our care,\u201d says Jonathan S. Lewin, MD, CEO of Emory Healthcare. \u201cFinding an organization that aligns with our values and missions to improve the health of the communities we serve was critical as we move forward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProMedica has a strong skilled nursing care presence in Atlanta, and we are excited to partner with another forward-thinking health care organization to provide the community with enhanced post-hospital services,\u201d says Randy Oostra, FACHE, ProMedica\u2019s president and chief executive officer. \u201cWorking with Emory Healthcare to bring innovative approaches to care that combine high tech with high touch, we seek to enhance the patient experience and improve health outcomes. Together, we will offer a truly unique health care alternative in our community for those recovering from illness, injury or surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica is currently looking for locations in metro Atlanta to build the two new facilities, which are expected to take two years to build once regulatory approval is received. The state-of-the-art facilities will feature private rooms and baths and innovative therapy areas focused on getting patients safely back into the community. The centers will also have attractive social and multi-purpose areas, specialized dining services and beauty and barber services. Medically complex and intensive rehabilitation services supervised by specialty physicians, nurse practitioners and medical directors will be offered seven days a week to short-term patients transitioning from hospital to home, in addition to 24-hour skilled nursing care.</p>\n<p>When the management agreement takes effect on Sept. 1, Emory Healthcare employees working at Budd Terrace will remain Emory Healthcare employees, however they will be supervised by ProMedica. Once the newly built centers are open in the near future, employees and patients will transition and the current Budd Terrace facility will be closed.</p>\n<p>A key provision of the joint venture is forming a quality joint operating committee with clinical staff to focus on reducing preventable re-hospitalizations, creating a seamless patient experience, improving patient satisfaction and outcomes and engaging in future strategic planning. Both Emory Healthcare and ProMedica executives will be a part of the joint operating committee.</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,264787\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The dual emergency and urgent care facilities eliminate the need for patients to self-diagnose the severity of their health concerns before selecting the most appropriate medical center for care. The new patient-centered model is designed to simplify the way patients access immediate, appropriate care while also lowering out-of-pocket costs.</p>\n<p>\u201cProMedica is excited to partner with Intuitive Health to bring the hometown Five-Star services of ProMedica Toledo Hospital closer to home for patients who live or work in the Toledo suburb, Maumee, and the surrounding communities,\u201d said Dawn Buskey, ProMedica president of acute care. \u201cIntuitive Health pioneered the freestanding Emergency Center and Urgent Care model in 2008. Since then, the company has partnered with leading health care systems across the nation to establish and operate freestanding Emergency Center and Urgent Care facilities in 10 major U.S. markets.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica Toledo Hospital Emergency and Urgent Care will have a full-service ER open 24 hours a day and an urgent care open 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week. Each facility is equipped with on-site lab equipment, a radiology suite with X-ray and multi-slice CT scanners, and staffed with board-certified, ER-licensed physicians. The ER physician examines each patient and determines if the appropriate care is emergent or urgent care. Patients are billed accordingly, only paying for the level of care they need, which eliminates unnecessary emergency room visits.</p>\n<p>\u201cHealth care is changing, and consumers are demanding better service with an emphasis on convenience, safety and value. Our combined Emergency and Urgent Care model provides the convenience and efficiency of a top retailer while delivering the highest level of clinical care and customer service that patients demand. Patients no longer need to plan around their provider's schedule, and they no longer need to self-triage whether they need emergency or urgent care. Instead, they can come to our facility any time of day and receive the right level of care without having to pay more than is appropriate,\" said Thom Herrmann, CEO of Intuitive Health. \u201cOver 70% of our patients are treated and billed at the urgent care level.\u201d</p>\n<p>The 11,000 square-foot facility is designed to be warm and welcoming with an area designed just for children. Patients can receive care without an appointment, but they have the option to pre-register online if they prefer and can do so. Before treatment even begins, patients are informed whether they will be treated as an urgent care patient or as an emergency room patient, for which additional consent is needed.</p>\n<p>For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href=\"http://www.promedica.org\">promedica.org</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information about Intuitive Health, visit <a href=\"https://www.iheruc.com/\">iheruc.com</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,263731\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The TPE awards represent Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia's highest honor for performance excellence through innovation, results, and visionary leadership using the Baldridge Excellence Framework.</p>\n<p>By working within the Baldridge Excellence Framework set forth by TPE, ProMedica has been able to demonstrate a greater focus on patients, residents and members, along with improved process management, innovation, work systems, and organization-wide results. TPE acknowledged that organizations demonstrating such improvements typically experience lower costs, improved productivity, and increases in both employee and customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>TPE recognized ProMedica for its evolution into an integrated health and well-being organization that spans the continuum of health care, stating, \u201cIn keeping with its vision to create a transformational health and well-being model that integrates the physical and social needs of people at every stage of their life, ProMedica is a national pioneer and leader in social determinants of health.\u201d</p>\n<p>As part of the award evaluation process, TPE reviewed all aspects of ProMedica, including the organization\u2019s provider and clinical services, senior care services and Paramount health and dental insurance divisions. To qualify for this award, ProMedica was rigorously evaluated by an independent board of examiners in seven areas defined by the Baldridge Excellence Framework: leadership; strategy; customers; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce; operations; and results.</p>\n<p>\u201cProMedica has been on a multi-year journey with TPE and the Baldridge Excellence Framework, receiving top recognition for individual hospitals and gold-level recognition for the system the past two years,\u201d said Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica. \u201cWe are extremely honored to receive the highest-level regional recognition for our entire system this year, especially considering the added challenges presented by the pandemic.

We look forward to continuing our journey of excellence.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica is slated to be formally honored at an awards banquet later this year and recognized during TPE's annual Quest for Success virtual conference to be held September 13-14, 2021.</p>\n<p>As the recipient of TPE\u2019s highest-level award, ProMedica will be invited to apply for the national Baldridge award.</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,263156\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

As a member of the collaborative, ProMedica participated in data collection for the CovidSurg Week study by reviewing every surgery during one specific week in October, determining whether or not the patients had ever had COVID-19 and documenting their surgical outcomes. Due to the amount of data collection at ProMedica and the short timeframe, two teams of surgeons, residents, nurses, students, and researchers were established to effectively collect and submit the data.</p>\n<p>The COVIDSurg Collaborative, led by an international team of researchers, published its findings after studying data for 141,582 patients from across 1,667 hospitals in 116 countries -including Australia, Brazil, China, India, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States.</p>\n<p>The study determined that patients waiting for elective surgery should get COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the general population \u2013 potentially helping to avoid thousands of post-operative deaths linked to the virus.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have shown that surgical patients have additional risks with regard to COVID-19. As the global rollout of vaccinations continues, the CovidSurg Collaborative model suggests that surgical patients should be advised to complete the vaccination process prior to a medical procedure,\u201d said Tahir Jamil, MD, ProMedica Physicians General Surgery.</p>\n<p>The study found that between 0.6% and 1.6% of patients develop COVID-19 infection after elective surgery. Patients who develop COVID-19 infection are significantly at risk of death in the 30 days following surgery. A patient 70 years and over undergoing cancer surgery would usually have a 2.8% mortality rate, this increases to 18.6% if they develop a COVID-19 infection.</p>\n<p>The study also found that vaccination is likely to decrease postoperative pulmonary complications, which is key in reducing intensive care use and overall health care costs.</p>\n<p>As a result of the study, ProMedica encourages surgical patients to get vaccinated prior to elective surgery, with the recommendation that COVID-19 vaccine administration be finalized at least five days prior to surgery. ProMedica continues to test all patients for COVID-19 prior to surgery.</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,262411\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

It earned the Outstanding Achievement Award through the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer for three consecutive 3-year cycles.

ProMedica and GHHI will engage local partners to identify households, make home modifications and provide additional supports to families to improve their overall well-being.</p>\n<p>\u201cInvesting in housing is the most tangible way to address the health and economic opportunity gaps in under-resourced communities,\u201d said Ruth Ann Norton, president and CEO of the Green &amp; Healthy Homes Initiative. \u201cIt is a privilege to partner with ProMedica, a health care organization that shares GHHI\u2019s commitment to engaging communities in the solutions that will improve health, economic and educational outcomes for children and families in measurable and meaningful ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Learn more about how ProMedica is addressing the <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/social-determinants-of-health/\" style=\"color: #008000;\">Social Determinants of Health</a></span>.</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,261828\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Powered by Kumanu\u2019s PurposeCloud\u2122 platform, Resourceful supports employers by addressing unrecognized Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) issues that can have a profound impact on employees\u2019 quality of life and work.</p>\n<p>SDOH are social and economic factors that are often root causes of employee health issues, lost productivity, and reduced engagement. SDOH directly impacts nearly one-third of all working Americans, according to a national survey conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of ProMedica and Kumanu in December 2020.</p>\n<p>Factors such as food insecurity, financial stress, housing insecurity, childcare or eldercare struggles, emotional well-being, and a lack of reliable transportation along with behaviors account for over 70% of health outcomes, according to the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. A ProMedica/Harris Poll survey conducted in December 2020 revealed that 24% of full-time workers in the U.S. had experienced food insecurity issues and 20% of respondents were worried about stable housing, and 27% said they were experiencing childcare challenges.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnmet employee needs related to Social Determinants of Health can have a significant impact on health and business outcomes,\u201d said Randy Oostra, president and chief executive officer of ProMedica. \u201cProMedica\u2019s decade-long experience in this area demonstrates that by effectively addressing SDOH needs, employers can help improve quality of life for employees while better positioning their companies for future success.\u201d</p>\n<p>Until now, employers have lacked practical solutions to assess these unrecognized risk factors \u2013 and, more importantly, meaningful solutions to address them. Resourceful empowers employers that want to demonstrate empathy and care for their employees by identifying unmet needs and by providing appropriate, accessible resources to address them.</p>\n<p>Resourceful is a customizable platform designed for employers to de-stigmatize these issues and fill critical SDOH gaps unmet by traditional employer benefits and wellness solutions. Resourceful identifies risk factors in an employer\u2019s workforce and helps activate people with purpose and connect them with resources available at work, or in their community, confidentially.</p>\n<p>By identifying and connecting employees to resources, Resourceful can strengthen individuals\u2019 resilience to be better able to bring their best selves to work. Employers benefit when employees\u2019 emotional well-being and essential needs are being addressed.</p>\n<p>The ProMedica National Social Determinants of Health Institute and Kumanu's purpose experts will provide consultative services for employers and customize the Resourceful platform to each organization\u2019s unique needs to enhance existing employer wellness programs.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are emotionally and physically burned out and are struggling in many ways. The current mix of employer well-being solutions is falling short and fails to identify all of the factors that cause people hardship,\u201d said Vic Strecher, Ph.D., Kumanu founder and CEO. \u201cFor the first time, Resourceful empowers employers to address essential needs and improve their employees\u2019 sense of dignity by addressing the unmet SDOH needs and providing stigma-free, technology-driven access to resources.\u201d</p>\n<p>To start supporting your employees with Resourceful, visit us at <a href=\"https://www.kumanu.com/resourceful/\">kumanu.com/resourceful/</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,261490\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

These goals will be met through comprehensive activities structured around screening, medication assisted treatment (MAT), naloxone distribution, linkages to care and a real-time treatment finder.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u201cThe ED has proven to be a successful access point to reach all patients presenting to the ED with a history of opioid misuse, positive opiate drug screen and at-risk individuals being discharged with opioids,\u201d said Kaminski. \u201cThe ED serves a wide variety of patients, including those who are experiencing health disparities and health inequities, as well as those who are uninsured and/or without access to primary care.

Workit Health will support activities associated with MAT and transition patients to long-term care, both on demand and through existing community resources. FindLocalTreatment will support access to real-time addiction treatment services, and CAES will provide evaluation services.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,261375\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The state-of-the-art facility, which is to have 96 beds, will be housed on four floors in the former Deaconess Hospital at 4229 Pearl Road. It will provide medically complex and intensive rehabilitation services for short-term patients transitioning from hospital to home, in addition to 24-hour skilled nursing care.

Technology is one of the fastest-growing industries in the United States and positions in the field are high-wage, high-growth jobs. The Bitwise model empowers communities of concentrated poverty to access quality jobs in the fastest-growing industry in the global economy.</p>\n<p>As Bitwise opens a regional office in Toledo at the innovation center, it expects to generate hundreds of jobs over time.

For a community to improve, opportunities need to exist for everyone in the community. That understanding motivates ProMedica to partner and invest in catalytic projects like the innovation center to spur economic development and support a better quality of life for everyone in the community.</p>\n<p>ProMedica\u2019s investment in the innovation center builds upon the work the organization has been doing as part of the ProMedica Ebeid Neighborhood Promise in the Uptown neighborhood. Accordingly, the innovation center will have a strong focus on jobs, education, health, stability and resident engagement.</p>\n<p>With ProMedica\u2019s strong commitment to innovation in health care, including leveraging technology to provide more hospital-level care to patients at home, there is a growing need for technologically savvy employees. The high-tech job training that will occur as part of this partnership will help support the workforce needs in health care and beyond.</p>\n<p>The innovation center's location will be the former Jefferson Center, which ProMedica is in the process of acquiring. The Jefferson Center is expected to undergo a renovation, and Bitwise will be a partner in the development of the innovation center. The center will also serve as a business incubator for technology and non-technology businesses to foster synergies and create new opportunities. Building renovations are expected to begin in late 2021, and occupancy will start in early 2023.

In Lucas County alone, heart disease and stroke accounted for 35 percent of deaths from 2016 \u2013 2018, according to the Ohio Department of Health. The 2019-2020 Lucas County Health Assessment found that 29 percent of Lucas County adults had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, 27 percent had high blood cholesterol, 38 percent were obese, and 15 percent were smokers \u2014 four known risk factors for heart disease and stroke.</p>\n<p>To reverse this trend, ProMedica and the American Heart Association encourage the community to go red and take charge of heart health in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule an appointment with your health provider: Learn about your health status and risk factors.</li>\n<li>Get active: The American Heart Association recommends getting at least two hours and 30-minutes of moderate physical activity each week.</li>\n<li>Eat healthily: A heart-healthy diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, fiber and whole grains and low in sodium.</li>\n<li>Know the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and stroke: Heart attack symptoms differ in men and women, and time is brain when it comes to a stroke.

The goal of the investment is to help support a neighborhood that traditionally has experienced disinvestment, which has disproportionally affected people of color. Reinvesting in neighborhoods like the Junction is a critical step in creating infrastructure and opportunities for all of our neighbors.</p>\n<p>To support this community, the Owens Corning Foundation helped fund the grant investment program. \u201cWe realize the positive impact this investment will have in the neighborhood and the greater community, and we are pleased to join forces to help make a lasting difference,\u201d said Don Rettig, president of the Owens Corning Foundation.</p>\n<p>Kicking off the program in fall of 2020, ProMedica sought grant applicants that could help in the areas of education and training, health and wellness, jobs and finances, stable housing and basic needs for the Junction neighborhood.</p>\n<p>To ensure the grant application review process included resident input, ProMedica engaged community partners and neighborhood leaders through several community meetings. The stakeholders were instrumental in the process, reviewing neighborhood-level data and plans and administering a survey to gauge neighborhood need.</p>\n<p>Shantae Brownlee, a Junction neighborhood resident and stakeholder who participated in the community meetings, said, \u201cThe process of selecting the programs that would make the most impact on our community was extensive, but I\u2019m proud of the selections and looking forward to real change.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica received more than 40 applications. Twenty projects and 18 organizations were identified to receive funding based on the goals, predicted outcomes and programming that addressed specific health and human service challenges facing the Junction community.</p>\n<p>The MLK Kitchen for the Poor is among the organizations receiving funding. The Kitchen currently serves meals to more than 200 people each day, from school-aged children to the elderly. The grant investment program will fund its food box and hot meals program. \u201cThis past year, more than ever, we have been seeing people in need of basic necessities. Providing hot meals and food boxes makes a tangible difference in the health of our community. My late father opened the Kitchen in 1969, and this funding will continue his legacy,\u201d said Harvey Savage, Jr., executive director, The MLK Kitchen.</p>\n<p>Another organization to receive grant funding is the Neighborhood Health Association, which provides access to quality medical care for anyone in need. The grant program will fund the \u201cSaving Ourselves\u201d program, which seeks to staff a full-time community organizer. The organizer will connect Junction residents to basic needs and organize residents in the development and implementation of a strategy for changing the health status of the community. \u201cProviding the right access allows us to empower and educate while aggressively working to eliminate health care inequities,\u201d said Doni Miller, chief executive officer, Neighborhood Health Association.</p>\n<p>The first installment in the grant payments for the two-year cycle will start January 2021, enabling organizations to begin programming at the beginning of the year. Funding is for a minimum two-year period and contingent upon successful, demonstrable achievement of outcomes.</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,260691\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The solution offers a network of services and health care professionals who are available to respond to a patient\u2019s health concerns at any time.</p>\n<p>The health care model offers individualized care plans and a variety of features, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week access to a patient\u2019s care team that will respond to medical needs in person, by video and/or telephone</li>\n<li>Patients are under the care of a hospitalist and they receive daily video visits by the physician and acute care nurses</li>\n<li>Vital signs obtained using remote monitoring equipment</li>\n<li>In-home visits by health care professionals, such as mobile integrated health paramedics, registered nurses, nurse practitioners and physical and occupational therapists</li>\n<li>Lab tests, mobile imaging like X-ray and ultrasound, and IV therapies performed in a patient\u2019s home</li>\n<li>Durable medical equipment like shower chairs, grab bars, oxygen and hospital beds</li>\n<li>Collaboration with a patient\u2019s primary care physician and/or specialists</li>\n<li>Complete report of a patient\u2019s care sent to his or her primary care physician</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u201cWhen we live by our mission and values, we create an environment that is centered around our patients. The goal of ProMedica Acute Care at Home is to deliver acute hospital-level care to patients in the comfort of their own home,\u201d said Holly Bristoll, chief integration officer, ProMedica. \u201cBy providing this level of care when appropriate, we are able to improve patient outcomes while reducing health care costs and enhancing the patient experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica admitted its first patient to ProMedica Acute Care at Home on October 1, 2020. The service, which is covered by some commercial insurance plans, is one of the first in the nation to receive approval for a special waiver from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). The waiver, developed to help U.S. hospitals and health systems manage inpatient volume during the COVID-19 pandemic, enables ProMedica Toledo Hospital and ProMedica Flower Hospital to provide ProMedica Acute Care at Home to qualified Medicare patients. ProMedica plans to request CMS approval for additional hospitals within its system soon.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are glad we have ProMedica Acute Care at Home up and running, especially given the needs associated with the current pandemic,\u201d said Bristoll. \u201cAlso, we are grateful CMS recognized the benefits of being able to treat qualified acute care patients in home settings and acknowledged ProMedica\u2019s ability to appropriately and safely provide this innovative care.\u201d</p>\n<p>A 2016 study by the Commonwealth Fund compared patients in traditional hospitals with similar conditions to patients who received hospital-level care at home. The patients who received hospital-level care at home experienced fewer readmissions, lower mortality rates, reduced falls and lower costs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition to enabling better outcomes for patients, the ProMedica Acute Care at Home option allows patients to be more engaged and empowered with their medical care,\u201d said Brian Perkins, MD, vice president, medical operations, ProMedica Acute Care at Home. \u201cDoctors and nurses can see patients who are in the comfort of their own living space, and help evaluate any physical barriers in the house, stay abreast of dietary needs or changes, and monitor emotional health and well-being.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica chose Medically Home Group as its ProMedica Acute Care at Home partner based on the organization\u2019s innovative clinical and services model for delivering acute-level hospital care in the home. Medically Home\u2019s technology platform and associated decision-support and advanced analytics functions allow physicians and nurses to manage all aspects of a patient\u2019s care, the supply chain needed to deliver that care in the home, and the collection and proper handling of patient data, meshing with hospital electronic health record systems.</p>\n<p>\u201cTogether with ProMedica, Medically Home leadership shares a passion for transforming health care to include stronger bonds between patient and health care provider, reduced costs, improved clinical outcomes, faster recovery times, and a return to a more compassionate delivery of high-acuity care in the patient's home, when appropriate,\u201d said Rami Karjian, CEO of Medically Home.</p>\n<p><i>The Hospital at Home Model: Bringing Hospital-Level Care to the Patient (Sarah Klein, Martha Hostetter and Douglas McCarthy; Commonwealth Fund; 2016)<br></i></p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,260186\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The updates involve community projects in Toledo, Ohio, where the national organization is headquartered.</p>\n<p>The first update involves a gift ProMedica recently committed to Metroparks Toledo to help support the Glass City Metropark &amp; Riverwalk development. ProMedica has agreed to donate $10 million to the project over the next six years. The gift will help create a well-designed public green space with a range of activities in the city\u2019s core where people can connect, recreate, exercise, relax, discover, learn, and experience the health benefits of nature. The park project is also expected to benefit the community by attracting visitors, creating jobs, driving economic growth, and conserving and preserving its most important natural resources.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the need to socially distance ourselves much of this year, many of us have developed an even greater appreciation for Metroparks Toledo and the role it plays in our community,\u201d said Robin Whitney, Chief Strategic Planning and Real Estate Officer, ProMedica. \u201cProMedica has long been aware of the health and well-being benefits associated with outdoor activity and being in nature. So, we are excited to join our community in supporting a world-class park project that will bring the positive physical and mental health benefits of being outdoors to our most urban setting. We expect this to be a truly transformative project that revitalizes our waterfront, unites multiple neighborhoods from both sides of the river, and attracts others to our community to create opportunities and support ongoing economic development.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis gift to the community, through the Metroparks Toledo Foundation, will help Metroparks keep its promise to leverage the taxpayers\u2019 investment and transform our waterfront into the showpiece of our region,\u201d said Joe Napoli, president of the Foundation. \u201cHaving ProMedica as a lead partner in this philanthropic effort makes a strong statement about the value of Riverwalk to our community.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Randy Oostra's vision and ProMedica's leadership in creating the Downtown Master Plan and their partnership with Metroparks to acquire the Marina District got us to where we are today,\" said Scott Savage, president of the Board of Park Commissioners. \"Today's announcement is another significant contribution to making the Toledo region a healthier, more vibrant place to live.\"</p>\n<p>The second project for which there is an update relates to ProMedica\u2019s 2019 announcement about its gift to help with the redevelopment of the SeaGate Convention Centre. As an acknowledgment of ProMedica\u2019s early commitment to the project, the Toledo-Lucas County Convention and Visitor\u2019s Bureau granted ProMedica the exclusive right to name the convention center. The name chosen by ProMedica is the Glass City Convention and Event Center.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe chose a name that reflects our community\u2019s unique history, current accomplishments, and hope for an even brighter future, said Whitney. \u201cThe \u2018Glass City\u2019 moniker is not original, but it emphasizes a major point of pride in our community, with glass having long been part of our industry, art and architecture. As we eventually move beyond the pandemic, we look forward to our community being able to promote a thoughtfully redeveloped convention and event center with a name that evokes pride locally and sparks interest nationally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are grateful to ProMedica for being our naming rights partner for the convention center as we begin a new era to attract high-caliber events and attractions to the region. The Glass City Convention and Event Center will play a key role in a reenergized downtown Toledo. We look forward to a continued relationship with ProMedica and we are excited for this new partnership, new direction, and new name,\u201d said Tina Skeldon Wozniak, President of the Board of Lucas County Commissioners.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Commissioners and ProMedica share the same vision for our community in our desire to make Toledo and Lucas County a destination for visitors and to have a healthy, vibrant quality of life for everyone. The Glass City Metropark and the expanded Glass City Convention and Event Center with a dedicated ballroom will be game changers to the local tourism economy and a catalyst for regional growth,\u201d said Commissioner Pete Gerken.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring this national public health crisis, we have learned the value that our residents place in the outdoor experience and their appreciation of our Metroparks. The Glass City Metropark and Riverwalk will create new opportunities for our community to improve their health and explore the outdoors - and it truly complements the new ballroom and renovated convention center. We congratulate the ProMedica leadership for making these incredible contributions to our community,\u201d said Commissioner Gary L.

Patients received either one or two doses of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells manufactured by Stemedica Cell Technologies at its Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliant California State-licensed facility. The first set of patients was treated with one dose of 100 million cells, and the second set received two doses of 50 million cells.</p>\n<p>The stem cell treatment resulted in an improved clinical course for the patients. Within 24-48 hours of receiving the stem cells, all patients had a significant reduction in oxygen requirements. Several patients went from an inability to talk or eat due to shortness of breath to speaking in full sentences and eating full meals comfortably shortly after treatment.</p>\n<p>The study also found improved inflammatory modulation. In fact, 88 percent of patients had a significant reduction in acute phase reactants, which are markers for reductions in inflammation. The subsequent reduction in inflammatory markers resulted in a reduced \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 in 88 percent of patients. Researchers noted that these patients experienced quicker extubation, less lung trauma and less oxygen toxicity.</p>\n<p>The stem cell treatment also seemed to accelerate post-discharge recovery. At their one-month follow-up appointments, the patients who received stem cells improved at a faster rate than comparable patients not treated with stem cells. The stem cell treated patients were tolerating more activity, walking farther and not requiring home oxygen when evaluated at 30 days post discharge.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has been really exciting for ProMedica to conduct this innovative research, and we are very encouraged by the results. We\u2019re eager to move into the next phase of the study because of the significant potential to help COVID-19 patients, in particular those who continue to experience lung damage after contracting the virus,\u201d said Greg Kasper, vice president medical affairs, metro region, ProMedica. \u201cThe residual circulating stem cells end up residing in the lungs as a reservoir, which may lead to improved long-term lung health and a better quality of life post-COVID-19.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica is working to secure funding to advance a Phase 2 study in conjunction with Stemedica, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of progenitor cell and protein therapeutics for underserved medical conditions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know that the immune-modulating properties of stem cells are quite remarkable in that they block the cytokine storm. COVID-19 offers a new frontier for exploring the potential benefits of stem cell therapy and, in particular, a clinical reduction of inflammation. The early findings and clinical outcomes of the study with ProMedica are encouraging, and we are hopeful to move into the next phase soon. Together, we have an opportunity to speed up the discovery of new treatments and potentially minimize the devastation of this pandemic,\u201d said Nikolai Tankovich, president and chief medical officer, Stemedica.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,256323\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Over the past couple of months, our system has learned a great deal about treating COVID-19, and we are well-prepared to do so safely in specially designated areas at all of our hospitals. That\u2019s why we decided that it was time to transition Bay Park Hospital back to normal operations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nThe first step in transitioning Bay Park Hospital to normal operations was to routinely treat and admit COVID-19 positive and suspected positive adult patients at their local ProMedica hospitals starting on May 14. Soon after, Bay Park Hospital began accepting non-COVID-19 admissions.</p>\n<p>\n\u201cWe have taken a systematic, phased-in approach to resuming normal hospital operations,\u201d said Dr. Ravi Narra, vice president of medical affairs at ProMedica Bay Park Hospital. \u201cJust as we strategically designated Bay Park Hospital as the centralized COVID-19 facility, we have been very thoughtful about returning to normal operations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nThe next step was to re-open surgery services at Bay Park Hospital. Consistent with state guidelines, Bay Park is performing all essential surgeries and non-essential surgeries that do not require an overnight stay. Ambulatory diagnostic testing capabilities at Bay Park Hospital resumed on May 18. These include non-time sensitive fluoroscopy, mammograms, ultrasound, DEXA, and lung cancer screenings.</p>\n<p>\nProMedica Physicians\u2019 offices in the Bay Park Medical Office Building that were impacted by the hospital\u2019s COVID-19 designation began re-opening for in-person visits over the past few weeks.

Patients will be able to receive treatment for a range of emergency conditions, including chest pain, stroke, severe shortness of breath, trauma injuries, allergic reactions, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, seizures, severe pain, uncontrollable bleeding, broken bones, cuts, burns and more. Should a condition require additional advanced treatment, surgery or inpatient care, patients would be stabilized and transported to the top-rated, nationally recognized ProMedica Toledo Hospital main campus. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the new facility will include an urgent care for minor injuries and illness. By combining a freestanding emergency department and urgent care within the same facility, patients will be able to quickly receive the most appropriate and cost-effective care at one location. </p>\n<p>Pending final plan approvals, construction of the 11,000 square-foot facility is expected to begin in the summer of 2020 with a grand opening slated for the summer of 2021.

Fifteen non-profit organizations benefitted by receiving a portion of beverage sales.</p>\n<p>Planning for the 2020 ProMedica Summer Concert Series was well underway before the COVID-19 pandemic was declared. ProMedica would like to recognize the generous sponsors that had already pledged their support prior to the cancelation: Coors Light, City of Toledo, Fifth Third Bank, Great Lakes Sound, Hylant, iHeartRadio, Laibe Electric/Technology, Owens Corning, Paramount and Stevens Disposal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe understand how disappointing this announcement may be to the tens of thousands of supporters who look forward to the concert series every year,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut, because the concerts attract such large crowds, we believe canceling the series is the socially responsible decision. We\u2019re hoping to bring the concerts back next summer.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,255087\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

The hospital initially had 30 beds, with no maternity ward, intensive care unit, or special treatment areas. During the first few years of operation, the hospital had only 12 total personnel, including the superintendent, six registered nurses, one bookkeeper, one cook, one maid and one janitor. The hospital was named Fostoria City Hospital until the 1990s until it was renamed Fostoria Community Hospital. </p>\n<p>Throughout the years Fostoria Community Hospital experienced many major changes, expansions and growth, including new hospital units, medical services and technology. A few most notable changes came in the 2000s. In 2000, the hospital became affiliated with ProMedica, ending its independent, public healthcare status and becoming a private hospital. In 2002, the hospital underwent it\u2019s largest expansion which included a 30,000-square-foot addition on the south side of the hospital's emergency center, a brand new surgery department on the second floor, and upgraded radiology and diagnostic imaging capabilities. Then in 2003, Fostoria Community Hospital became designated as a Critical Access Hospital through a federal program that entitles small, rural hospitals to Medicare cost reimbursement.</p>\n<p>While the hospital has seen enormous growth and change to its facility, the dedicated, compassionate care it provides to patients has not changed. \u201cWhat makes Fostoria Community Hospital what it is today \u2013  a strong, anchor institution \u2013 I think of the doctors, nurses and staff. The individuals working at the hospital are committed to the Fostoria community and caring for the people they call their neighbors,\u201d says Tom Borer, vice president of operations, ProMedica  Fostoria Community Hospital. </p>\n<p>\u201cPatients in the community can trust that when they walk through the doors of Fostoria Community Hospital, they will be seen by compassionate, dedicated staff, many of which have worked at the hospital since the start of their career,\u201d said Marsha Cushman, DO, chief of staff, ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital.</p>\n<p>Becky Bouillon, RN, community outreach coordinator, ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital, has worked at the hospital for over 42 years. As a lifelong resident of Fostoria, she is proud to have found a career in the town where she grew up. \u201cThe family atmosphere and caring employees are what has made my career at Fostoria Community Hospital so special. The names, faces and uniforms have changed, but the community commitment and focus on patient health has not,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had to do it all over again, I would choose to be a nurse at this community hospital.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of our roots in the Fostoria community,\u201d said Pam Jensen, president, regional acute care - Ohio and support services, ProMedica. \u201cWe understand that having access to high quality care is a critical part of a person\u2019s health and well-being, and we\u2019re always evaluating our programs and services to ensure we\u2019re providing essential services to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fostoria Community Hospital had a 90th anniversary celebration planned for staff and the community on May 11, 2020, but the hospital has postponed the gathering due to the Coronavirus. A new date will be determined later this year. </p>\n<p><strong><em>ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital </em></strong><em>is a member of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

Instead, they will be used in general areas for patients, visitors and nonclinical staff. ProMedica wants to make them available to help keep all employees and our limited visitors safe. The community donation of these masks will enable us to provide masks for everyone in the general areas without depleting the hospital-acquired surgical masks that are needed for patients. All collected masks will be immediately sent to laundry/processing to be prepared for use. Surplus masks will be distributed to local organizations in need.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the CDC recommendation, ProMedica is recommending that people wear homemade masks when in public.

Our system is continuing to take aggressive steps to minimize the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We are here to provide the very best care to our patients, especially in challenging times when the sickest, weakest and most fragile need us the most. We take that responsibility seriously. If we need to reschedule your appointment or limit visitors to all our facilities in coming days and weeks, know that this is because we are trying to protect those in our care.</p>\n<p>We realize that this is unprecedented for our community. We also know that rumors and social media can frequently increase anxiety and stress. We are working hard to communicate clearly and proactively.

This grant cycle, beginning Feb. 1, will reflect new requirements issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br> <br> Established in 1995, Teen PEP focuses on sexual-violence prevention education as well as teen dating violence and bullying prevention. The project is based on the CDC-evaluated, evidence-based curriculum Expect Respect: A School-Based Program Promoting Safe and Healthy Relationships for Youth, and integrates concepts from Safe Dates. The goal of the program is to train students as teen leaders to reduce the incidence of sexual violence in northwest Ohio.<br> <br> Danielle Cisterino-Hajdu, project director of the Teen PEP program said, \u201cI\u2019m proud to report that the Teen Pep program has some remarkable results. Statistically, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men report being sexually assaulted between the ages of 11 and 17. Program participants demonstrate an increase of up to 60 percent in knowledge related to sexual assault prevention.\u201d<br> <br> The CDC is shifting the focus from lesson-driven activities to having the students develop policy and action plans for unsafe areas at schools.&nbsp;<br> <br> The program will now include more adult professional hospital and program staff to support and guide the youth-led services. These services will focus on awareness, education and action planning around unsafe zones in schools where bullying and other forms of harassment and/or violence might be taking place. Additionally, teens will lead the development of messaging campaigns to create healthy cultural norms for their peers.<br> <br> Teen PEP experts will train youth leaders on how to be change agents in their community. Cisterino-Hajdu explains, \u201cThe Ohio Department of Health wants us to build strong relationships and be a presence in our partnering schools, working with select groups of youth leaders to form healthy cultural norms that help prevent sexual violence and teen dating violence specifically.\u201d<br> <br> For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href=\"/service-to-the-community/teen-pep\">www.promedica.org/TeenPep</a>.</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">var hierarchalData = \"268992,264500,264364,255075\";</script>\n\t\t\t\t\t",

Mammography is a specific type of imaging test that uses a low-dose X-ray system to examine breasts. A mammography exam, called a mammogram, is used to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of breast diseases in women. </p>\n<p>\u201cFostoria Community Hospital is proud to be an ACR accredited and trusted site for patients receiving radiology services such as mammography,\u201d said Nathan Egbert, MD, medical director of radiology at Fostoria Community Hospital. \u201cProviding the highest level of image quality and safety is a top priority, as we know mammograms are critical for an early detection of breast cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ACR gold seal of accreditation represents the highest level of image quality and patient safety. It is awarded only to facilities meeting ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards after a peer-review evaluation by board-certified physicians and medical physicists who are experts in the field. Image quality, personnel qualifications, adequacy of facility equipment, quality control procedures and quality assurance programs are assessed. The findings are reported to the ACR Committee on Accreditation, which subsequently provides the practice with a comprehensive report that can be used for continuous practice improvement. </p>\n<p>The ACR, founded in 1924, is a professional medical society dedicated to serving patients and society by empowering radiology professionals to advance the practice, science and professions of radiological care. The College serves more than 37,000 diagnostic/interventional radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, and medical physicists with programs focusing on the practice of medical imaging and radiation oncology and the delivery of comprehensive health care services.</p>\n<p>For more information about ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital, visit <span style=\"color: #009900;\"><a href=\"/location/promedica-fostoria-community-hospital\">www.promedica.org/fostoria</a></span>. </p>\n<p><strong><em>ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital </em></strong><em>is a member of ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

TCAR is a clinically proven, minimally invasive approach for high surgical risk patients who need carotid artery treatment.</p>\n<p>Carotid artery disease is a form of atherosclerosis, or a buildup of plaque, in the two main arteries in the neck that supply oxygen-rich blood to the brain. If left untreated, carotid artery disease can often lead to stroke; it is estimated to be the source of stroke in up to a third of cases, with 400,000 new diagnoses of the disease made every year in the U.S. alone.</p>\n<p> \u201cTCAR is an important new option in the fight against stroke, and is particularly suited for the large portion of patients we see who are at higher risk of complications from carotid surgery due to age, anatomy, or other medical conditions,\u201d said Sophie Afridi, MD, ProMedica Physicians Vascular Surgeon. \u201cBecause of its low stroke risk and faster patient recovery, I believe TCAR represents the future of carotid repair.\u201d</p>\n<p>TCAR is unique in that blood flow is temporarily reversed during the procedure so that any small bits of plaque that may break off are diverted away from the brain, preventing a stroke from happening. A small incision in the neck is done to limit the pathway the wire has to travel, minimizing the risk of stroke. A stent is then placed inside the artery to stabilize the plaque.</p>\n<p>Prior to TCAR, the main treatment option for severe carotid artery disease was an open surgical procedure called carotid endarterectomy (CEA). CEA removes plaque from inside the carotid artery to restore normal blood flow to the brain, but the large incision leaves a visible scar the length of the neck and carries risks of surgical complications that can cause issues with swallowing, speaking and sensation in the face. </p>\n<p>For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href=\"/\">www.promedica.org.</a></p>\n<p><em><strong>ProMedica Toledo Hospital </strong>is a member ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

They will perform 16 haircuts in four rounds inspired by styles through the decades from the 1950s to 2000s, and they will participate in a final round inspired by works in the TMA collection.</p>\n<p>These predominantly African American barbershops are among the participants in ProMedica\u2019s Barbershop Health and Wellness Program, which provides barbers with education on prostate cancer and other screenings as well as health educational materials they can distribute to their clients.</p>\n<p>In 2018, ProMedica\u2019s Health and Wellness program expanded to address the significant health disparities of African American men as reported in the recent Lucas County Health Needs Assessments and the Ohio State Health Improvement Plan. These reports reveal health disparities in the African American male community with regard to heart disease, diabetes, prostate and colorectal cancer. Representatives will discuss these health disparities during the event.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe barbershop program is about fostering trusting relationships between the community and healthcare providers while providing health screenings, health education, and resource information,\u201d explained ProMedica Cancer Institute Community Liaison Robin Charney, who leads the program. \u201cThe response from the participating barbers has been phenomenal. They have the ear and the trust of the community and have allowed us to expand our health education and screening efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvents like Art of the Cut celebrate those community connections,\u201d Charney said. \u201cArt presents us with an opportunity to bring the community closer, and every encounter we have with each other is an opportunity for wellness.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Art of the Cut is sponsored by Circle, a Museum affinity group whose diverse, civically, and culturally engaged members work with TMA and other community organizations to develop new, innovative ways of connecting the Toledo community with the Museum and art.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe positive effect that art can have on health is often overlooked,\u201d explained TMA Leadership Fellow Alyssa Greenberg. \u201cThe event positions art as something that is a positive social good; art is for everyone; art is even for people who think art is not for me. For the barbers, their effectiveness as community leaders and men's wellness advocates has everything to do with their capacity as artists.\u201d</p>\n<p>Les Levesque from Tal Mon, one of the Barbershop Program participants, is looking forward to participating in The Art of the Cut because of its potential to create connections.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe live in a divided society, so this is an important opportunity to bring people together for a cause,\u201d Levesque said. \u201cHealth and haircuts are two things that everyone needs so it was a natural fit to help educate my clients and the community about health screenings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Joining Levesque as co-hosts at the event are Jamal Grant (Da Shop), Tawann Gaston (Groomed), Stacey Fletcher (Fletcher's), Steve Parker (Steve's Sport-n-Cuts), and James Foster (James Foster).</p>\n<p>About Toledo Museum of Art</p>\n<p><em>Since its founding in 1901, the Toledo Museum of Art has earned a global reputation for the quality of our collection, our innovative and extensive education programs, and our architecturally significant campus.

Toledo Hospital was awarded the Cardiac Cath Lab Accreditation with PCI in August based on rigorous onsite evaluation of the staff\u2019s ability to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients who come to the cardiac cath lab.</p>\n<p>PCI is also known as coronary angioplasty. It is a procedure that opens narrowed or blocked coronary arteries with a balloon to relieve symptoms of heart disease or reduce heart damage during or after a heart attack. Hospitals that have proven exceptional competence in treating patients who require cardiac catheterization have standardized their assessment process for patients before undergoing catheterization to ensure quality and patient safety. They ensure that care in the procedure room for sedation, infection control, radiation safety, universal protocol, and time out procedures is fully coordinated. They have also mastered the appropriate transfer to a cath recovery unit to better monitor and track complications, enhance physician-to-patient communication, patient family communication, discharge instructions and follow-up information.</p>\n<p>Hospitals receiving Cardiac Cath Lab Accreditation with PCI from ACC must take part in a multifaceted clinical process that involves: completing a gap analysis; examining variances of care; developing an action plan; a rigorous onsite interview; and monitoring for sustained success. Improved methods and strategies of caring for patients include streamlining processes, implementation guidelines and standards, and adopting best practices in the care of cath lab patients. Facilities that achieve accreditation meet or exceed an array of stringent criteria and have organized a team of doctors, nurses, clinicians and other administrative staff that earnestly support the efforts leading to improved patient outcomes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur physicians, care providers and staff members are pleased to be recognized as one of only 13 cath labs in the United States, and the only one in Ohio, to be awarded with this accreditation,\u201d said Praveen Tamirisa, MD, president, ProMedica Heart Institute. \u201cOur physicians and clinicians are dedicated to improving the care for patients who need cardiac interventions through standardized processes to improve patient outcomes.\u201d The ACC offers U.S. and international hospitals like Toledo Hospital access to a comprehensive suite of cardiac accreditation services designed to optimize patient outcomes and improve hospital financial performance. These services are focused on all aspects of cardiac care, including the cath lab.</p>\n<p><em><strong>ProMedica</strong> is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

With HCR ManorCare being the nation's second largest post-acute and long-term care provider, this partnership has enabled ProMedica to significantly scale its system to become the 15th largest in the nation. The combined organization provides an unmatched breadth of services and capabilities, including: a hospital system, a physician group, telehealth, several health plans, an academic affiliation, skilled nursing, assisted living, rehab, home health and hospice.</p>\n<p>Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica, is the CEO of the combined organization. Steve Cavanaugh, former CEO of HCR ManorCare, now serves as the president of the HCR ManorCare division at ProMedica.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis partnership is groundbreaking. Together, we will redefine health care and its role in healthy aging,\u201d said Randy Oostra, president and CEO at ProMedica. \u201cWe are focused on tearing down the walls between care delivery channels to provide simpler navigation across the care continuum, along with greater value. Further, we see a tremendous opportunity to engage ProMedica\u2019s nationally-recognized, social determinants of health work to benefit seniors across the communities we serve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis relationship is exciting because of all of the opportunities it creates. No other organization in the country offers the breadth of services and capabilities of our combined organizations,\u201d said Steve Cavanaugh, president, HCR ManorCare division at ProMedica. \u201cWe are looking forward to leveraging our resources to create a new way of delivering better care and improving outcomes.\u201d</p>\n<p>While hospitals will always play a significant role in healthcare delivery, the \u201cbaby boomers\u201d are aging and their expectations for safe and value-based health care are different than any other prior generation. Forecasts indicate that the 85-and-older population in the United States is expected to double over the next 20 years. This growth will exacerbate the inefficiencies of the current fragmented and costly health systems. This partnership is uniquely positioned to address these challenges by seamlessly coordinating care across multiple health delivery channels to improve quality and reduce the overall cost of care.</p>\n<p>Toledo, Ohio-based Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), the leading global real estate capital provider to the healthcare industry, played a major role in facilitating this transaction through its innovative approach to using healthcare infrastructure to optimize healthcare delivery to lower cost sites of care while driving improved outcomes.</p>\n<p>\u201cTogether with ProMedica, one of the largest and most innovative health systems in the U.S., this acquisition of HCR ManorCare provides us the platform to think differently about where healthcare services are delivered, particularly with respect to the aging of the population,\u201d said Tom DeRosa, Chief Executive Officer of Welltower. \u201cThe close of this transformative joint venture further validates our health system strategy through which we leverage high-quality real estate to optimize care delivery at lower cost sites of care while remaining focused on improved outcomes.\u201d</p>\n<p>For more information about ProMedica, visit <a href=\"/\">www.promedica.org</a>.</p>\n<p> Download more information. </p>\n<p><em><strong>ProMedica </strong>is a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization headquartered in Toledo, Ohio.

This is a community initiative to strengthen neighborhoods by addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH) with a key focus on health, education, jobs and family stability.&nbsp;The donation is designed to specifically address education, hunger and nutrition.</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">SDOH, or the conditions in which people live, work and play are an important part of their overall well-being. Up to 80% of an individual\u2019s health can be attributed to lifestyle, environment and socioeconomic factors such as education, job status, income and community safety.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">\u201cWe all have the ability to use our resources to impact others. That\u2019s something Russ Ebeid knew, and continues through the Eidi family.\u201d said Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO. \u201cRamy and Faye are a shining example of the spirit we all know and want to embrace; to get up every day and say \u2018I\u2019m going to make an impact.\u2019 They\u2019re an example to our community, and their ability to make an impact is special.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">ProMedica is continuously enhancing its clinical care to include SDOH screening and interventions, as well as to improve SDOH indicators across the communities served. To help accomplish this goal is to help provide the tools, education and resources to improve health and well-being.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">\u201cMy main goal in life can be broken down into two parts: to be a good role model to my children, so they can see I set a precedent of a strong education, work ethic and to always strive for success,\u201d said Ramy Eidi. \u201cSecond is to work hard and build on my success so I can continue to give back as much as I can to Toledo and northwest Ohio. This region has given me so much, giving back while I\u2019m alive is the least I can do and the only thing I can take with me at the end.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">The ENP will offer a full range of social and educational services to address community needs with a specific focus on children and families. The ENP\u2019s goal is to significantly expand on the scope and purpose of the ProMedica Ebeid Institute to improve health and well-being starting with the UpTown area and later expanding to the Monroe Street Corridor and eventually outlying communities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"ms-rteElement-P\"><em><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">ProMedica</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" class=\"ms-rteStyle-Normal\"><em><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-Normal\"> </span></em></span></em><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><em>is a member of Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit integrated healthcare organization serving communities in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

Notably, the partnership will leverage funds for a major initiative announced last year called the Ebeid Neighborhood Promise (ENP), which is revitalizing Toledo\u2019s UpTown community, where more than half of residents live in poverty and 30 percent are unemployed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>New investments and grants will focus on helping families grow employment skills and boost incomes and education. The goal is to improve community safety, finance healthy homes and vibrant businesses, and ensure communities have quality greenspace and jobs. It is a model that can be replicated in communities across the country.</p>\n<p>\u201cHealth care has traditionally invested heavily in high-tech clinical care and state-of-the-art facilities, yet we underinvest in programs to improve socioeconomic factors. This is despite scientific evidence of how these factors greatly influence a person\u2019s health status,\u201d said Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO. \u201cFor several years now, ProMedica has been devoting more resources to address social needs. Now through this partnership with LISC, we will maximize the impact of our efforts, starting in UpTown, and demonstrate the power of partnering with other sectors to accomplish a shared goal.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ProMedica has been screening and studying the impact of social needs on the health of its patients, finding that financial strain, employment, behavioral health, and access to healthy food are among the most critical indicators. As an anchor institution, it also serves as a catalyst for community collaboration and economic development, including ensuring that area neighborhoods thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cYour zip code should not determine your prospects in life,\u201d said Maurice Jones, president and CEO of LISC, a national community development organization that has invested more than $19 billion to spur economic opportunity in struggling areas. \u201cBut, right now, your community is the single largest predictor of how well and how long you will live. We have to focus on social, economic and health challenges\u2014all in the same place at the same time\u2014if we want to give families the best chance possible to thrive.\u201d</p>\n<p>The partnership includes a $20 million pool of grants, half from each organization, that will be deployed over 10 years for community programs and services. It also includes a new $25 million loan fund that will finance development projects that would not otherwise move forward. Of the total lending pool, ProMedica is investing $10 million and LISC is investing $15 million.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Importantly, the partners will work with health researchers to develop a new framework for evaluating how these kinds of community investments impact health--integrating data on financial, educational and clinical outcomes to identify what works.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are taking a data-driven approach that will demonstrate exactly how we\u2019re making a difference,\u201d said Kate Sommerfeld, ProMedica president of social determinants of health. \u201cOur end goal is to develop a national model and best practices that we can replicate across ProMedica\u2019s region and share with other health systems.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The investment effort builds on the partners\u2019 long-time commitment to these issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ProMedica, which operates in 28 counties in Ohio and Michigan, has emerged as a national leader on social determinants, demonstrating how health institutions can leverage their expertise and resources to advance key goals.</p>\n<p>For 40 years, LISC has been investing in thousands of urban and rural communities across the country, including $150 million in Toledo since 1989. In late 2017, LISC announced it would deploy an anticipated $10 billion in national investments over the next decade in ways that are specifically designed to upend health disparities, as well as raise overall standards of living. The partnership with ProMedica is the first national collaboration designed to support LISC\u2019s expanded health focus.</p>\n<p>\u201cHealth care institutions can wield remarkable influence over social determinants, not just by the care they provide but by the data they have on place-based health challenges,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen we connect their talent and their resources to the expertise of community developers, we have an opportunity to drive changes that help people live better\u2014literally adding years to their life. That\u2019s incredibly powerful.\u201d</p>\n<p>To move forward, LISC and ProMedica will begin working with community partners and stakeholders in UpTown this month to engage residents. An operations team based at UpTown\u2019s ProMedica Ebeid Institute will focus on expanding job-training opportunities for residents and onboarding additional community health workers, financial coaches and jobs coaches who will provide free services to the community.</p>\n<p>For more information about the ProMedica and LISC partnership, visit <span style=\"color: #009900;\"><a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/ebeidpromise\">www.promedica.org/ebeidpromise</a></span>.</p>\n<p><strong>ProMedica </strong>is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southern Michigan.

The Micra\u00ae Transcatheter Pacing System (TPS) is a new type of heart device, approved for Medicare reimbursement, that provides patients with the most advanced pacing technology at one-tenth the size of a traditional pacemaker. The first procedure was performed by electrophysiologist, Kamala Tamirisa, MD, FACC, FHRS.</p>\n<p>Bradycardia is a condition characterized by a slow or irregular heart rhythm, usually fewer than 60 beats per minute. At this rate, the heart is unable to pump enough oxygen-rich blood for the body during normal activity or exercise, causing dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath or fainting spells. Pacemakers are the most common way to treat bradycardia to help restore the heart\u2019s normal rhythm and relieve symptoms by sending electrical impulses to the heart to increase the heart rate.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional pacemakers, Micra\u00ae is comparable in size to a large vitamin and does not require cardiac wires (leads) or a surgical \u201cpocket\u201d under the skin to deliver a pacing therapy. Instead, the device is small enough to be delivered through a catheter and implanted directly into the heart with small tines, providing a safe alternative to conventional pacemakers without the complications associated with leads.</p>\n<p>The Micra TPS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2016, and has been granted Medicare reimbursement, allowing broad patient access to the novel pacing technology.</p>\n<p>To learn more about heart services offered at ProMedica Heart Institute, visit promedica.org/heart.</p>\n<p><em>ProMedica Toledo Hospital&nbsp;is a member of Toledo, Ohio-based ProMedica, a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

We look forward to working together to further enhance the quality of healthcare services and build on the hospital\u2019s long-standing commitment to the residents of Branch County.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has been an exciting journey for us,\u201d stated Randy DeGroot, president and CEO, ProMedica Coldwater Regional Hospital. \u201cJoining ProMedica enhances our ability to provide the very best care for our communities. By collaborating and expanding our clinical expertise, as well as broadening access to needed services, residents of Branch County and the surroundings communities will experience more effective and efficient care.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica Coldwater Regional Hospital, a not-for-profit organization, serves south central Michigan. The hospital and its physician practices offer a wide range of diagnostic, medical and surgical services in areas such as behavioral health, emergency medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, oncology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, primary care, podiatry, pulmonary, urology, wound healing, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 87-bed hospital has more than 600 employees and 190 physicians and advanced practice providers on the hospital\u2019s medical staff. In 2016, Coldwater Regional Hospital provided care for its community through more than 142,000 outpatient visits, 56,200 clinic visits, 24,600 emergency visits, and 2,800 admissions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hospital receives regular recognition for its quality including its safety initiatives and obstetrics care. Most notably, the Michigan Hospital Association recently awarded Coldwater Regional Hospital with the Ludwig Community Benefit Award for the hospital\u2019s school tele-medicine program. The program increases access to primary care for the community\u2019s youth by using tele-medicine to connect the hospital\u2019s pediatric and adolescent center with local high school health clinics that are staffed by hospital nurses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DeGroot added, \u201cTo ensure a seamless transition for our patients, employees and physicians, our integration team will continue its diligent and collaborative work. In addition, over the next several months, strategies will be developed to expand services in our community. The goal will be to attract a broader offering of medical specialties to Branch County and surrounding communities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Next week, on Monday, Jan. 8, 2018, Oostra will visit Coldwater to hold a series of employee forums as well as to meet with hospital leaders, physicians and community members. At noon, a public ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held in the main lobby of the hospital, located at 274 E.

Nonetheless, breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths among women.</p>\n<p>Until now, most women having surgery to remove a breast tumor (lumpectomy)  had to undergo a \"wire localization\" procedure where a wire is inserted into the tumor and served as a road map for the breast surgeon to remove the diseased tissue.\n</p>\n<ul class=\"standard-list module\">\n    Although widely used, wire localizations have known complications for women:\n    <li>The guide wire must be inserted the same day prior to surgery which causes discomfort and worsens pre surgical anxiety. The wire may be in place for hours if surgery is unexpectedly delayed. Occasionally,  difficulty in wire placement may result in long delays for surgery start times. </li>\n    <li>Because the guide wire protrudes from the skin,  there is an increased risk for infection. </li>\n    <li>Wires can also move or be dislodged</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Magseed directly addresses these complications. First, it is smaller than a grain of rice and can be placed into a tumor up to 30 days before the patient\u2019s surgery. Deployment of the Magseed is quick and easy.  Once the seed is implanted, it produces no discomfort rarely moves and stays within the breast. During surgery, a magnetic probe called a Sentimag detects the Magseed, guiding the surgeon to the tumor. The Sentimag probe and Magseed provideds more accurate removal of cancerous tissue, ensuring that more healthy tissue can be left behind (better cosmetic result).</p>\n<p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Magseed in 2016. In January 2017, The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) became the first US site to adopt Magseed as its standard of care. Shortly after in August, ProMedica Toledo Hospital adopted Magseed as its standard of care becoming the first hospital in the area to use the new technology \u2013 thanks in part thanks to The Toledo Hospital Foundation, who purchased the probe for <a href=\"/location/promedica-breast-care\">ProMedica Breast Care</a>.</p>\n<p><em>ProMedica is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

It marked the end of three and half years of planning and construction to consolidate approximately 1,000 system employees from more than 25 buildings on a single campus.</p>\n<p>The ProMedica Headquarters project included the restoration of a vacant former steam plant that was on the National Register of Historic Places, the renovation of an adjacent building and the construction of a parking garage. The $60 million investment has sparked further economic development in downtown Toledo with additional businesses relocating to the area and new restaurants opening up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs an anchor institution, we have a responsibility to reinvest in our communities and we\u2019re happy to play a role in the revitalization of downtown Toledo,\u201d said Randy Oostra, president and CEO of ProMedica. \u201cAdditionally, the new ProMedica Headquarters has transformed our workplace culture. Our administrative employees \u2013 the employees that support our caregivers \u2013 are more efficient and the open office environment has been great for team building.\u201d</p>\n<p>ProMedica Headquarters features modern design while honoring the history of Toledo and the former steam plant. Key elements include:<br>\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A history wall is located along a corridor of The Steam Plant provides a visual timeline of downtown Toledo\u2019s history covering important events in the area from 1650 to the present.<br>\n\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A 13-ton bridge crane on the original crane rail is suspended above The Steam Plant\u2019s four-story atrium.

It affects more than 2.7 million Americans, according to the American Heart Association.</p>\n<p>With every heartbeat, your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat \u2013 pumping blood from the upper chambers of your heart to the lower chambers and out to the rest of your body.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you experience AFib, the electrical signal that starts your heartbeat is jumbled. It causes the upper chamber of your heart to contract and relax too fast and irregularly. Then, your upper chamber becomes out of sync with your lower chamber, causing blood to pool in your upper chamber\u201d says Timothy Phelan, MD, electrophysiologist with ProMedica Physicians Cardiology.</p>\n<p>The danger? Dr. Phelan explains, \u201cPooling blood can form a blood clot that may escape your heart and lodge in an artery leading to your brain. This causes a stroke.\u201d In fact, people with AFib are five times more likely to have a stroke than those without AFib.</p>\n<p>AFib can present with a number of different feelings in your chest. \u201cThese symptoms may occur once in a while or all of the time and can range from mild to severe discomfort\u201d says Dr. Phelan. And, although these are common symptoms, some people do not experience symptoms. This is true for about 30% of people with AFib.</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing symptoms of AFib schedule an immediate appointment with a cardiologist.

It offers a broad range of services, including X-rays, lab testing and simple sutures, for a low urgent care copay compared to the more expensive emergency center cost for the same service. In addition, ProMedica Urgent Care offers the consumer the options to walk-in or preregister their visit by calling ahead, This allows the urgent care to better manage your wait time. The centers feature additional convenience with upfront pricing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are setting a new standard for medical care with a primary focus on providing appropriate care in the right setting that is more expedient and affordable. We also want to prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room,\u201d said Lee Hammerling, MD, chief medical officer, ProMedica. \u201cUrgent care is one of the fastest growing specialties in the medical field due to the extended hours and immediate availability. It is a trend that we expect to see increase locally and nationally.\u201d </p>\n<p>Over the past 20 years, there has been a major boom in the urgent care industry driven by demand for immediate access to medical care. According to the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine, the number of urgent care facilities in the United States increased from 8,000 to 9,300 since 2008. Approximately 50 \u2013 100 new sites open each year.</p>\n<p>To meet this growing need, ProMedica Urgent Care offices are open during the day as well as evenings, weekends and holidays. Certified nurse practitioners (CNPs) treat adults, children and infants as young as six months. CNPs are registered nurses with advanced medical training and education to treat a broad range of primary care needs. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a highly-trained and experienced medical team ready to handle a wide variety of minor injuries, infections and other urgent medical needs,\u201d said Cindy Edwards-Tuttle, family nurse practitioner \u2013 board certified, ProMedica. \u201cTelemedicine technology will allow for face-to-face consultations with hospital emergency room doctors and other specialists to expedite care as needed. We are connected with your primary care providers and provide clinical summaries of the visit so that your doctor is aware of your urgent care needs and how we managed your care during the visit.\u201d </p>\n<p>ProMedica has the region\u2019s largest network of primary and specialty care services with nearly 1,000 physicians and advanced medical providers in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan. Our nurse practitioners are able to make referrals to our specialists to expedite access for follow-up care and to assure the highest quality of care is provided.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur urgent care and after hours clinics are designed to ensure that our patients always have a lower cost of care option for medical care and are well-connected to ProMedica\u2019s hospitals and medical facilities,\u201d said Edwards-Tuttle. \u201cWhether it is a routine medical need or a minor emergency, we\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d</p>\n<p>For more information about ProMedica Urgent Care, visit <a href=\"/services-and-conditions/urgent-care\" tabindex=\"0\">www.promedica.org/urgentcare</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>ProMedica</strong> is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.

Working with the Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC), the corporations will work to upgrade affordable rental properties while at the same time making it easier for first-time homebuyers to establish roots in communities adjacent to downtown Toledo.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cKey has long invested in the growth of the central Toledo community and today\u2019s major gift from the Key Foundation not only continues that tradition, but elevates it to another level,\u201d said Jim Hoffman, KeyBank market president. \u201cWe know that a critical part of any community is stable affordable housing. Individuals earning below the area median income benefit from programs and services that help lower their monthly rent and provide secure, stable housing. With this groundbreaking investment, we are furthering our commitment to helping central Toledo families reach their full potential, driving economic development, and helping neighborhoods thrive.\u201d</p>\n<p>The new collaboration reinforces the efforts of the city\u2019s YR 16 task force\u2014focused on preserving 700 units of rental housing that have aged out of federal financing programs and attracting a diversified economic base of nearby homeowners. That not only makes Toledo communities stronger, but also recognizes the clear connection between better housing and better health, and the long-term implications for all of Toledo\u2019s residents, according to Randy Oostra, ProMedica president and CEO.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a growing focus in the healthcare industry on the connection between substandard housing and an increased risk of chronic health conditions. We\u2019re seeing more research that points to it being a major public health issue,\u201d Oostra explained. \u201cFor years, ProMedica has been purposefully focused on social issues that impact health and well-being and we are pleased to be working with KeyBank, the City of Toledo, LISC and other area organizations to collectively improve area health outcomes.</p>\n<p>The new effort also recognizes a growing economic imperative in Toledo where 25 percent of renters spend more than half of their income on housing. This leaves less of their earnings for basic necessities such as food, clothing, healthcare and transportation. Accordingly, this creates a ripple effect on nearby businesses and schools, affecting everything from crime to property values.</p>\n<p>Kim Cutcher, executive director of LISC\u2019s Toledo program, also pointed to the impact of leverage from this investment. \u201cWhen we strengthen the economic base of local residents, we can attract other investment to these neighborhoods. Entrepreneurs are more likely to open businesses. People can shop in their own community. It helps rev up the local economy and people live better, longer and healthier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cutcher pointed to the importance of the YR 16 task force in advancing that strategy. In addition to LISC, the task force includes the City of Toledo Department of Neighborhoods, NeighborWorks Toledo Region, Ohio Housing Finance Agency, the Lucas County Land Bank, the National Equity Fund and the Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing. The project will leverage an additional $5 Million from the City of Toledo, LISC, the Lucas County Land Bank and NeighborWorks Toledo Region.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through this collaboration, 200 area residents will become homeowners over a three-year period. ProMedica, KeyBank, LISC and NeighborWorks will provide funding for this initiative that will go toward home loans and assisting residents with making upgrades to their homes.<br>\n<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>ProMedica</em></strong><em> is a mission-based, not-for-profit healthcare organization serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.
