She went on to graduate from Lourdes with her Bachelor of Science in Nursing and her Master of Science in Nursing is from the University of Cincinnati.</p><p>Tiffanie's passion for nursing started at a young age and her desire to learn more and to be able to provide more to patients is what led her to becoming a nurse practitioner. She loves the one on one with her patients and the ability to teach them to care for themselves. Tiffanie truly can’t imagine doing anything different. <br><br>Tiffanie enjoys her work as a family nurse practitioner as she is able to see multiple family members which helps her better treat the family unit as a whole. She loves the variety of patients that she sees in a day; she might have a newborn well visit in one room and an 80 year old Medicare wellness visit in the next room. Tiffanie believes that patients have a desire to live a healthy life and it is her job to give them the tools to do that. <br><br></p>",

    "about_me": "<p></p><p>Dr. Raul Bosio is a board-certified colon and rectal&nbsp;surgeon. He graduated from the University of Cordoba School of Medicine in 1997&nbsp;as valedictorian. He completed a five-year general surgery residency at the&nbsp;Hospital Aleman of Buenos Aires, Argentina, followed by a 2-year colon and&nbsp;rectal surgery fellowship at the Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires. He has been&nbsp;involved in minimally invasive laparoscopic colon and rectal surgery since the&nbsp;early 2000s.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>In 2005, he joined the&nbsp;department of surgery at the University of Toledo, and was involved in colon&nbsp;and rectal cancer research, as well as participating in basic science, translational,&nbsp;and clinical research. In 2011, Dr. Bosio completed an ACGME- accredited&nbsp;general surgery residency at The University of Toledo and became&nbsp;board-certified in general surgery. He completed further training by repeating&nbsp;his fellowship in colon and rectal surgery at the University of California,&nbsp;Irvine. During this time, he acquired significant expertise in minimally&nbsp;invasive laparoscopic colon and rectal surgery and robotic colorectal surgery,&nbsp;working under the mentorship of world-renowned experts. </p><p>Dr. Bosio’s areas of interest include diagnosis, treatment&nbsp;and long-term follow- up of patients with colon and rectal cancer, inflammatory&nbsp;bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), and diverticular&nbsp;disease and associated complications (i.e. colovesical fistula, diverticulitis,&nbsp;stricture, colon perforation or obstruction). Dr. Raul Bosio joined ProMedica&nbsp;Physicians in 2016, after being part of the colon &amp; rectal surgery section&nbsp;at Case Western/University Hospitals in Cleveland. </p><p>Dr. Bosio understood long ago that being an excellent physician requires excellent surgical results and the ability to listen to&nbsp;patients and families, while taking the time to explain the disease and the&nbsp;proposed treatment plan. A patient-centered approach ensures treatment options&nbsp;are chosen based on the patient’s individual needs and preferences. As part of&nbsp;the process of striving for excellent outcomes, restoring or improving&nbsp;patient’s quality of life is of paramount importance in Dr. Bosio’s care&nbsp;philosophy. As it is often the case when treating patients with chronic&nbsp;diseases, Dr. Bosio and his health care team focus on working with the patient<br>and family to make sure they know there is a team of professionals<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>with them, no matter how hard it may get.&nbsp;Close and frequent communication with multiple health care providers, from&nbsp;PCPs, gastroenterologists, oncologists and others, ensures the primary focus&nbsp;remains on improving the health and well-being of every patient. </p><p>Dr. Raul Bosio is part of ProMedica Physicians General&nbsp;Surgery and focuses on colon and rectal surgery. His practice is located in the&nbsp;ProMedica Health and Wellness Center, where he works alongside some of the best&nbsp;general surgery specialists in the area. He has been an integral member of this&nbsp;multi-specialty general surgery practice since 2016. Close collaboration&nbsp;between subspecialties allows for improved patient care across the spectrum of&nbsp;gastrointestinal pathologies and abdominal wall issues (i.e. complex ventral&nbsp;hernias). Multimodal surgical solutions are offered to patients with complex&nbsp;diseases, such as those requiring combined procedures or may benefit from&nbsp;multi-organ resections.</p><p>Dr. Bosio has a faculty appointment as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Surgery at The University of Toledo, College of Medicine and Life Sciences.</p><p></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>",

Ebeid Children’s Hospital as well as a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toledo College of Medicine. Dr. Ruddy graduated from Ohio State University College of Medicine and Public Health.

Because each child is unique, it is important to get to know each patient well so that treatment can be based on individual needs as much as possible. She strives to provide thorough evaluation and management and provide detailed education and explanation of the condition. She encourages patients and families to ask questions, and believes that all questions are good questions. She feels that routine follow up visits are very important for many pediatric pulmonary conditions. Her goal is that by working as a team with patients and their families to provide the best care possible, they will be able to lead their lives to the fullest.</p></div>",

    "about_me": "<p>Sonyoung Seo-Patel, MD is a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN).</p>\n\n<p>Obstetrics is the medical field that focuses on caring for women while they are pregnant and during the postpartum period after the baby is born.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.</span></p>\n<pr>\n<strong>Care philosophy</strong>: All patients need to be heard. Dr. Seo-Patel does her very best to work with her patients to provide the care and management plan that best suits their needs and goals. She feels that longitudinal care is important. She wants to get to know her patients so that they both feel comfortable with each other especially when tackling very personal issues. The OB/GYN profession deals with very sensitive parts of the body, and she want her patients to feel respected and comfortable.<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>More about me</strong>: Dr. Seo-Patel was raised in New York City, but her training took her all over the country. She believes this provides her a unique and diverse perspective on patient care and also cultural sensitivity.</p></pr>",

Many people have pain issues, sleep concerns, loneliness to be heard, reassurance of being human and not crazy, and too many more conditions to be named.  Danine continues reading the latest research and science publications of new medications, treatments, combined treatments, and discusses with others via networks of associations with other national and international nurse practitioners and psychiatrists.</p><p><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">She enjoys what she does, enjoys meeting the many people she has met throughout her career and looks forward to meeting many new people going forward.  Danine recognizes she do not have all the answers, not even close, but she appreciates the hard work each person has done between appointments and has taken on any hurdles or bumps along the way to improving their mental health to enjoy the moment and plan their future.  Each person that reaches their individual optimum mental health becomes a success that brings smiles, laughter, and just conversation of hard work that brightens their life and future!</span></p>",

Gynecology is a women's health specialty that screens for and treats diseases and conditions of the female reproductive organs. Gynecologists help diagnose cervical and ovarian cancers and treat irregularities or painful conditions in people who menstruate.<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Care philosophy</strong>: While attending the University of Michigan, Dr. Drenchko rowed varsity crew. Being a student-athlete for four years largely inspired his philosophy of a team approach to healthcare.  The patient is always the team leader and he serves to be a promotional aspect of her healthcare journey.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More about me</strong>: Dr. Drenchko was raised in Shelby Township, Michigan. His father was an OB/GYN and his mother was a figure skating instructor. When he is not practicing medicine, he enjoys staying active; training at a gym or being outdoors. He loves to spend time with his family and friends. He's also a car and motorcycle enthusiast and can often be found riding his motorcycle at local raceways.</p>\n\n<p>A huge passion of Dr. Drenchko's is education. He is always working to educate himself through evidence-based literature and presentations. He is part of ProMedica's quality committee because providing exceptional evidenced based care is very important to him. He works hard to educate his patients so they can make informed decisions about their care. He also always looks forward to educating resident physicians and medical students. Dr. Drenchko is grateful and excited to be part of the new wave in promoting and optimizing women’s health care.</p></div>",

Dr. Tilson completed his family medicine residency in Youngstown, Ohio, where he served as Chief Resident in his final year of training.  Through his journey, he has learned how to practice highly effective medicine with the available resources, while caring for individuals from all different backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses.</span></p><p>Dr. Tilson was born and raised in southeast Michigan and enjoys all of the seasons and natural beauty that the state offers.

It is important for us to have people around us, cheering us on when we are doing well, keeping us positive when we feel like things are falling apart, and helping us sort things out when we are feeling lost and unsure of where to go next.  Sometimes we just feel we have a lack of support or that things are so difficult that we need professional help.</p><p>As a Licensed Master Social Worker and member of the Academy of Certified Social Workers, Douglas Lovell has worked directly with individuals in psychotherapy treatment for over 10 years assisting them in being more positive, feeling more satisfied, and bettering themselves.

It is also about treating a wide spectrum of diseases and being the first line of contact for the healthcare system. In doing this effectively I hope to gain the trust and establish great relationships with my patients. <br><br>I grew up in Columbus, OH and went to The University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences for my Master’s and Medical Degree. I then completed my residency at St. Joseph Mercy Livingston Family Medicine Residency where I was the Academic Chief Resident in my last year of residency before becoming certified by the American Board of Family Medicine. <br><br>Some interesting things that patients may not know about me would be that I have been skydiving before and I was a placekicker for John Carroll University in College. My interests include playing board games, riding bikes, personal finance, and spending time with family.<br></p>",

She is a board certified Orthopedic Clinical Specialist by the ABPTS. As a young mom herself, she especially enjoys and easily relates to patients in the early post-partum period. Sarah is an exercise enthusiast, has trained for triathlons and has a passion for nutrition and all things food. In her spare time, you will find her in the kitchen or spending time with her husband and two active little boys.</p>\n<h4>Care philosophy</h4>\n<p>I believe in a holistic approach to treatment; that the mind and body are strongly connected and must be treated concurrently for the best outcomes. I focus heavily on education with patients to help them understand how their bodies work, what their current impairments are and how to take ownership and control back into their own hands. My early career was heavily sports and orthopedic based, so now I combine my passion for an active lifestyle with women's health to help women return to the activities they love. It is important for the patient and provider to have a great teamwork relationship. My goal is to help patients achieve their goals, whether that is returning to daily activities, being active or even running a marathon!</p>\n<h4>Conditions Treated</h4>\n<p> Pelvic pain, perinatal and postpartum pain/dysfunction, diastasis recti, adolescent pelvic dysfunction and pain, urinary/fecal incontinence, myofascial pain, low back and hip pain, dyspareunia (painful sex), pelvic organ prolapse, somatic pelvic dysfunction </p>\n<h4>Procedures Performed</h4>\n<p> Pelvic floor physical therapy, manual therapy techniques, myofascial release, kinesiotaping, soft tissue mobilization, gait and running analysis. Patient education regarding fluid management, bladder and bowel education.</p>",

I strive to focus on patient education for better patient understanding of their condition to empower them to achieve their best outcomes with a treatment plan specifically catered for their needs. </p>\n<h3>Conditions Treated </h3>\n<p>Pregnancy and post-partum pain, chronic pelvic pain, diastasis recti, dyspareunia (painful sex), pelvic organ prolapse, stress and urge urinary incontinence, abdominal pain, constipation, fecal incontinence. </p>\n<h3>Procedures Performed: </h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy </li>\n    <li>Manual Therapy </li>\n    <li>Myofascial Release </li>\n    <li>Soft Tissue Mobilization </li>\n    <li>Patient education </li>\n    <li>Bowel/bladder education</li>\n</ul>",
